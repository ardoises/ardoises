## What is Ardoises?

Ardoises is a platform dedicated to formal modeling and verification.
that runs as a service at https://ardoises.ovh.
It differs from other (meta)modeling tools and platforms in several ways:

* it allows you to **define your models programmatically or graphically**,
  and to use or modify them collaboratively;
* it allows you to **define your own formalisms**,
  and helps you in this task by providing a collection of formalism parts
  that can be assembled together;
* it allows you to **use and share your own tools**,
  that can do model transformation, formal verification,
  import or export from various formats, ...;

Depending on your role, you may want to visit the following pages:

* [Ardoises for Model Developers](/Model.md)
* [Ardoises for Formalism Developers](/Formalism.md)
* [Ardoises for Tool Developers](/Tool.md)
* [Ardoises for its own Developers](/Developers.md)
